## RG
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Rain Gardens (RG) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a RG has less Runoff.
## RB
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Rain Barrels (RB) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a RB has less Runoff.
## GR
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Green Roofs (GR) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a GR has less Runoff.
## SWALES
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Swales (SWALES) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a Swale has less Runoff.
## PP
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Porous Pavement (PP) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a PP has less Runoff
## IT
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Infiltration Trench (IT) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a IT has less Runoff.
## BC
A very simple two Subcatchment model with and without Bio Cells (BC) on the Subcatchments. The Subcatchment with a BC has less Runoff.
